# Scafforge Process Failures

## Scope

- Maps each validated finding back to the Scafforge-owned workflow surface that allowed it through.

## Failure Map

### EXEC-GODOT-006

- linked_report_1_finding: EXEC-GODOT-006
- implicated_surface: repo-scaffold-factory managed template surfaces
- ownership_class: generated repo execution surface
- workflow_failure: Godot release smoke artifact reports PASS despite recorded runtime or command-failure evidence.

### EXEC-REMED-001

- linked_report_1_finding: EXEC-REMED-001
- implicated_surface: repo-scaffold-factory managed template surfaces
- ownership_class: generated repo execution surface
- workflow_failure: Remediation review artifact does not contain runnable command evidence.

### EXEC-REMED-001

- linked_report_1_finding: EXEC-REMED-001
- implicated_surface: repo-scaffold-factory managed template surfaces
- ownership_class: generated repo execution surface
- workflow_failure: Remediation review artifact does not contain runnable command evidence.

### FINISH003

- linked_report_1_finding: FINISH003
- implicated_surface: ticket-pack-builder and ticket contract surfaces
- ownership_class: managed workflow contract surface
- workflow_failure: Consumer-facing repo records a Product Finish Contract but is missing the finish-validation workflow lane that proves it.

## Root Cause Analysis

### EXEC-GODOT-006

- root_cause: The repo is treating a contradictory smoke artifact as release proof. A Godot export or release-validation run can record parse/script-load failures or command-level failure markers while the artifact still says PASS, which lets a broken runtime state look releasable.
- safer_target_pattern: Make smoke_test fail when Godot export/load output contains parse or script-load errors, and reject PASS smoke artifacts whose command blocks record non-zero exit codes or non-`none` failure classifications before release closeout.
- how_the_workflow_allowed_it: Godot release smoke artifact reports PASS despite recorded runtime or command-failure evidence.

### EXEC-REMED-001

- root_cause: A ticket created from a validated finding is being reviewed on prose alone, so the audit cannot confirm that the original failing command or canonical acceptance command was actually rerun after the fix.
- safer_target_pattern: For remediation tickets with `finding_source`, require the review artifact to record the exact command run, include raw command output, and state the explicit PASS/FAIL result before the review counts as trustworthy closure.
- how_the_workflow_allowed_it: Remediation review artifact does not contain runnable command evidence.

### FINISH003

- root_cause: The canonical brief declares finish acceptance signals, but the ticket graph does not guarantee a dedicated finish-validation owner or release dependency. Older repos can then close release work without any first-class lane that proves the recorded finish bar.
- safer_target_pattern: Seed FINISH-VALIDATE-001 for consumer-facing repos whenever the Product Finish Contract records finish_acceptance_signals, and require RELEASE-001 to depend on that finish-validation lane before closeout.
- how_the_workflow_allowed_it: Consumer-facing repo records a Product Finish Contract but is missing the finish-validation workflow lane that proves it.
