# Initial Codebase Review

## Scope

- subject repo: /home/rowan/womanvshorseVA
- diagnosis timestamp: 2026-04-16T19:32:54Z
- audit scope: managed workflow, restart, ticket, prompt, and execution surfaces
- verification scope: current repo state plus supporting logs

## Result State

- result_state: validated failures found
- finding_count: 4
- errors: 3
- warnings: 1

## Validated Findings

### Workflow Findings

### SKILL001

- finding_id: SKILL001
- summary: One or more repo-local skills still contain generic placeholder text or stale synthesized guidance instead of current project-specific procedure.
- severity: warning
- evidence_grade: repo-state validation
- affected_files_or_surfaces: .opencode/skills/stack-standards/SKILL.md
- observed_or_reproduced: project-skill-bootstrap or later managed-surface repair left repo-local skills in a placeholder or stale state, so agents lose concrete stack, validation, or asset-workflow guidance.
- evidence:
  - .opencode/skills/stack-standards/SKILL.md -> When the repo stack is finalized, rewrite this catalog so review and QA agents get the exact build, lint, reference-integrity, and test commands that belong to this project.
  - .opencode/skills/stack-standards/SKILL.md -> - When the project stack is confirmed, replace this file's Universal Standards section with stack-specific rules using the `project-skill-bootstrap` skill.
- remaining_verification_gap: None recorded beyond the validated finding scope.

## Code Quality Findings

### EXEC-GODOT-006

- finding_id: EXEC-GODOT-006
- summary: Godot release smoke artifact reports PASS despite recorded runtime or command-failure evidence.
- severity: CRITICAL
- evidence_grade: repo-state validation
- affected_files_or_surfaces: project.godot, .opencode/state/artifacts/history/finish-validate-001/smoke-test/2026-04-16T13-25-37-427Z-smoke-test.md
- observed_or_reproduced: The repo is treating a contradictory smoke artifact as release proof. A Godot export or release-validation run can record parse/script-load failures or command-level failure markers while the artifact still says PASS, which lets a broken runtime state look releasable.
- evidence:
  - release_lane_started_or_done = True
  - repo_claims_completion = False
  - FINISH-VALIDATE-001: PASS artifact command block records failure_classification tooling_parse_warning
  - FINISH-VALIDATE-001: SCRIPT ERROR: Parse Error: Could not parse global class "EnemyBase" from "res://scripts/enemy_base.gd".

### EXEC-REMED-001

- finding_id: EXEC-REMED-001
- summary: Remediation review artifact does not contain runnable command evidence.
- severity: CRITICAL
- evidence_grade: repo-state validation
- affected_files_or_surfaces: tickets/manifest.json, .opencode/state/reviews/remed-014-review-review.md
- observed_or_reproduced: A ticket created from a validated finding is being reviewed on prose alone, so the audit cannot confirm that the original failing command or canonical acceptance command was actually rerun after the fix.
- evidence:
  - ticket REMED-014 carries finding_source `EXEC-GODOT-CLASSNAME`
  - review artifact: .opencode/state/reviews/remed-014-review-review.md
  - missing exact command record

### EXEC-REMED-001

- finding_id: EXEC-REMED-001
- summary: Remediation review artifact does not contain runnable command evidence.
- severity: CRITICAL
- evidence_grade: repo-state validation
- affected_files_or_surfaces: tickets/manifest.json, .opencode/state/reviews/remed-015-review-review.md
- observed_or_reproduced: A ticket created from a validated finding is being reviewed on prose alone, so the audit cannot confirm that the original failing command or canonical acceptance command was actually rerun after the fix.
- evidence:
  - ticket REMED-015 carries finding_source `EXEC-GODOT-CLASSNAME`
  - review artifact: .opencode/state/reviews/remed-015-review-review.md
  - missing exact command record
  - missing raw command output evidence

## Verification Gaps

- The diagnosis pack validates the concrete failures above. It does not claim broader runtime-path coverage than the current audit and supporting evidence actually exercised.

## Rejected or Outdated External Claims

- None recorded separately. Supporting logs were incorporated into the validated findings above instead of being left as standalone unverified claims.
