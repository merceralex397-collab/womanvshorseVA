# Live Repo Repair Plan

## Preconditions

- Repo: /home/rowan/womanvshorseVA
- Audit stayed non-mutating. No repo or product-code edits were made by this diagnosis run.

## Triage Order

- package_first_count: 0
- subject_repo_follow_up_count: 0
- host_or_manual_prerequisite_count: 0

## Package Changes Required First

- None recorded.

## Post-Update Repair Actions

- Route 4 workflow-layer finding(s) into `scafforge-repair` for deterministic managed-surface refresh.

- After deterministic repair, rerun project-local skill regeneration, agent-team follow-up, and prompt hardening before handoff.

### REMED-016

- linked_report_id: EXEC-GODOT-006
- action_type: safe Scafforge package change
- should_scafforge_repair_run: yes
- carry_diagnosis_pack_into_scafforge_first: no
- target_repo: subject repo
- summary: Make smoke_test fail when Godot export/load output contains parse or script-load errors, and reject PASS smoke artifacts whose command blocks record non-zero exit codes or non-`none` failure classifications before release closeout.

### REMED-017

- linked_report_id: EXEC-REMED-001
- action_type: safe Scafforge package change
- should_scafforge_repair_run: yes
- carry_diagnosis_pack_into_scafforge_first: no
- target_repo: subject repo
- summary: For remediation tickets with `finding_source`, require the review artifact to record the exact command run, include raw command output, and state the explicit PASS/FAIL result before the review counts as trustworthy closure.

### REMED-018

- linked_report_id: EXEC-REMED-001
- action_type: safe Scafforge package change
- should_scafforge_repair_run: yes
- carry_diagnosis_pack_into_scafforge_first: no
- target_repo: subject repo
- summary: For remediation tickets with `finding_source`, require the review artifact to record the exact command run, include raw command output, and state the explicit PASS/FAIL result before the review counts as trustworthy closure.

### REMED-019

- linked_report_id: SKILL001
- action_type: safe Scafforge package change
- should_scafforge_repair_run: yes
- carry_diagnosis_pack_into_scafforge_first: no
- target_repo: subject repo
- summary: Populate every required repo-local skill with concrete current rules and validation commands; generated `.opencode/skills/` files must not retain template filler or stale synthesized workflow guidance.

## Ticket Follow-Up

- No subject-repo ticket follow-up was recommended from the current diagnosis run.

## Reverification Plan

- After package-side fixes land, run one fresh audit on the subject repo before applying another repair cycle.
- After managed repair, rerun the public repair verifier and confirm restart surfaces, ticket routing, and any historical trust restoration paths match the current canonical state.
- Do not treat restart prose alone as proof; the canonical manifest and workflow state remain the source of truth.
